## About Taylor

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/TaylorFirman_Headshot.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Taylor Firman is a data scientist from Denver, CO with a passion for science, baseball, politics, and generally mathematical things. He received a B.S. in Physics and Mathematics from the University of Puget Sound and a PhD in Molecular and Cellular Biophysics from the University of Denver with a dissertation entitled "Learning from Disorder and Noise in Physical Biology". His research centered around the role of noise and disorder in the realm of biology, using a combination of simulated and experimental data to demonstrate the occasional benefit of stochasticity. As a former Seattleite (and married to a former Philadelphian), Taylor may pay particular attention to the Seattle Mariners and Philadelphia 76ers in any sports-related analysis, but he will do his best to remain impartial and give due diligence to all sports franchises involved.
